# GST Reconciliation Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides a clear, step-by-step process for performing GST reconciliation using data from Xero and the IRD. Follow these steps to ensure accurate and compliant GST reconciliation.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Determine the Source of Data
- **For the most recent tax year (April 2024 - March 2025)**:
  - Use data from Xero if there are outstanding payments and a tax return has not yet been filed with the IRD.
- **For the tax year before that (prior to March 2024)**:
  - Use data from the IRD as it has already been filed.

### 2. Use Outstanding Amounts
- If the IRD hasnâ€™t assessed the GST periods yet, use the amounts outstanding per the Xero GST returns.

### 3. Extract GST Payable/Receivable
- **Option 1**: Directly use the amount from the balance sheet.
- **Option 2**: Pull the amount from the GST reconciliation sheet on Xero.

### 4. Refer to Specific Figures for Guidance
